# Regression--Classification-and-Clustering-of-Iris-Dataset
Iris Dataset is a multivariate dataset introduced by British statistician Ronald Fisher in his paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It is a very good example of linear discriminant analysis. It was collected to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three similar species, namely Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor.   The dataset consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris. Four features were measured from each sample, the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Ronald Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.
